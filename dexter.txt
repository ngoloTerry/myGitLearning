My name is Dexter. Dexter Morgan. I don't know what made me the way I am, but whatever it was left a hollow place inside me. 
People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well. It's my burden. I guess...
Well, can't blame my foster parents for that, they did a wonderful job raising me.
